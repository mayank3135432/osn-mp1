Current issues : 
Shell segmentation faults when enter is pressed without any input. --SOLVED
Segmentation fault for command reveal -la .. (whenever present directory itelf) --SOLVED
getgrgid returns NULL if the directory/file is of group 1000
reveal does not print in lexographic order (missing feature)
An input with a reseonable "log" substring gets ignored by update_hiatory(). Fix it by having the function analyze the tokens instead.
history file is overritten when program is run, preserve history across multiple sessions --SOLVED
Instructions:
if using semicolon in a command, make sure to leave a space
    echo hello ; reveal ..  # valid command
    echo hello;reveal ..  # invalid command
